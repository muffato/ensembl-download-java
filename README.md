# ensembl-download-java

This is some code I have developed during my PhD thesis to download genomes
and orthologues from Ensembl in Java, using the
[ensj](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ensj/) API.

The repository has been reconstructed from regular backups I had, but this
means there are no useful commit messages.
It is there for historical purposes, as a legacy. It worked at the time,
but I quickly decided to use BioMart instead.

It is very likely that the code won't work on recent versions of Ensembl !

## Dependencies

You will need to add two JAR files in your _CLASSPATH_:
- [`ensj-39.2.jar`](http://genesis.ugent.be/maven2/org/ensembl/ensj/39.2/ensj-39.2.jar)
- `mysql-connector-java-3.1.8-bin.jar`
